                    <p>As is common practice with almost all professional websites, this site uses cookies, which are tiny files downloaded to your computer, to improve your experience. </p>
                    <p>This page describes what information they gather, how we use it, and why we sometimes need to store these cookies. We will also share how you can prevent these cookies from being stored; however, this may downgrade or 'break' certain elements of the site's functionality.</p>

                    <h2>How We Use Cookies</h2>
                    <p>We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Unfortunately, in most cases, there are no industry standard options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the functionality and features they add to this site. It is recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not sure whether you need them or not if they are used to provide a service you use.</p>

                        <li>Login related cookies</li>
                        <li>We use cookies when you are logged in to remember this fact. This prevents you from logging in every time you visit a new page. These cookies are typically removed or cleared when you log out to ensure that you can only access restricted features and areas when logged in.</li>

                    <p>Hopefully, that has clarified things for you. As was previously mentioned, if there is something that you aren't sure whether you need or not, it's usually safer to leave cookies enabled if it interacts with one of the features you use on our site.</p>
